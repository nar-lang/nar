# Nar programming language

A typesafe functional scripting language.

Checkout the [Home page](https://nar-lang.com/) for more information.

## Compiling

To compile the language you need to have [golang compiler](https://go.dev) installed.

Next command will compile and install the `nar` binary into its default location.
```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ~/.nar/bin/nar ./cmd/nar/nar.go
```

## Installation

No additional installation required. Just put nar executable into your PATH if you want to use it globally.
